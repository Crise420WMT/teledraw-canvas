# Teledraw-Canvas

Teledraw-Canvas is an HTML5 Canvas drawing engine that is used in Teledraw.com. It is currently dependent on jQuery (1.5+), but the goal is to make it standalone eventually.

## How to use

Include jQuery and teledraw-canvas.js in your page, and from there it's as simple as creating a canvas element:

```html
<canvas id="test-canvas"></canvas>
```

and initializing the TeledrawCanvas:

```js
var canvas = new TeledrawCanvas('#test-canvas');
```
